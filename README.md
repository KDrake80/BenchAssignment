## Pet Calendar
### Motivation
**I Wanted to create an app that allows the user to create a calendar, to take care of their pet. I have an elderly cat, who has medications and things I need to track. So I wanted to write an app that allowed the user to create a care guide, enter in the age of the animal, the type, and breed, as well as any medications or vet visits. The app will query another website for information about your breed and age.**
